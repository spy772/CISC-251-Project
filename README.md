# CISC-251-Project

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to any local directory
2. Use an IDE (VS Code is recommended)
3. Run `pip install jupyterlab` in the terminal to install the notebook software on your device (MacBooks might need `pip3` instead) - not using venv since the command in step 3 doens't seem to work in a venv
4. Run `jupyter lab` in the terminal to run the notebook software
    1. Could also simply create `ipynb` files directly in the working directory, and also to work on them since VS Code has notebook integration, but it is nicer to use it within jupyter lab itself
5. Make any changes you'd like to do in the notebook software, including making and deleting files in the working directory
6. Be sure to save your changes as you go, close the local web app when done and `Ctrl + Z` in the terminal to stop the server running jupyter lab
7. Commit changes when satisfied
